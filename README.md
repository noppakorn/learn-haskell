# learn-haskell
Want to try out the [xmonad](https://xmonad.org/) window manager. It use Haskell for configuration, so why just copy and paste code(configuration) when you can learn the language. We'll see how long it takes until I give up.
## Learning Resource
- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) - It's awesome.
